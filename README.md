Project 1:
I wanted to pick the fountain as my AR base, so I thought about things that I could make that relate to the fountain. I thought of when the basketball team won a national championship in 1987 and a fish went missing from the fountain. I wanted to make some designs based on that and also maybe show a video of the end of the championship game. Below is one of the edits I made, putting a fountain fish in the hands of a player on the team.

Below is a picture that I added another player shooting and Bobby Knight in the background. Both pictures I combined were from the same game.

Project 2: I was stumped on what to make for my interactive collage, but I was eating chips and talking to my mom on facetime and she made a comment to me about the fact I was eating chips. She is Swedish and in Sweden they usually only eat chips and snacks and candy on Saturdays. It got me thinking about how Americans really do eat more snacks than other countries, and I wanted to highlight that. I found he Top 15 or so most popular snacks in America and was able to cut them out and place them all as PNG's. I made the cursor a Dorito chip and it left a trail of Dorito behind it. I had a button to reset the background.

Project 3: For my wearable prosthetic I chose to make a facelamp of sorts. Originally I planned to make a headlamp that gets brighter as it gets darker. I used the light sensor to my advantage and made it to so that more neopixels light up as it senses less light. I changed my idea to put the lights on the under side of my hat brim, so that it illuminates my face. I wanted to add another feature to it so I allowed one of the buttons to make the light turn green.

For my final project I wanted to explore p5js much more and find new and interesting ways to use it. I decided to use oneof my favorite pictures of. one of my favorite musical artists ASAP Rocky. I used code I found online that turns images into particles that can then be "pushed" by the cursor. I replaced the image that was in the code with the image of ASAP rocky. I then added the same image but upside down, so that the user can see what the non-particle image looks like and see the comparison. I added a background reset button so that once the user has changed the particles enough they can reset it to. the default. Finally I added a ASAP rocky song called "Everyday" in the background. 

Artist Statement:
With most of my work deriving from inspiration from sports designs and infographics, I have progressed into other professional forms of graphic design and digital art. With experience in digital marketing, my work aims to be appealing while attracting viewership from the intended audience. I emphasize consistency when working with a given outline. By consistency, I want the theme of the work to stay on brand as well as be simple and easy to read. I want the. Viewer to be amazed by my work and I want them to want to share the piece. Whether this means the colors of the graphics or the actual stylization or even both, I strive to portray the brand how they choose. I am excellent at creating a clean, minimalist style, but I donâ€™t aim to limit the brand by any means.

Over the past 6 years I have developed my Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator skills to allow me to be successful in creating my work. I have experience in other facets of digital art such as video, but these are my bread and butter. Photoshop allows me to transform any quality photograph into an informative and exciting piece of art that viewers want to look at. Illustrator allows me to create professional documents from scratch or even create brand assets that can contribute to my other work. I was inspired by sports teams and leagues on social media and the graphics that they create, as well as by everyday brands that create exciting advertisements to generate buzz. I love how these teams and leagues have designers who make eye-catching art that turns an ordinary image of an athlete into a stunning piece of art.
